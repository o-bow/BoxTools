# BoxTools

BoxTools is a suite of utilities designed to be used with a kind of "Box", made by the developer himself (you), in order to simplify daily tasks on his working project & environment, by automatizing/scriptizing them.

This usually involves Box CLI commands, Git operations, and some local file manipulations that we usually do to make a given project start in local environments.

I've made this as I'm using it myself, but feel free to use it as you wish.

At this stage **I do not intend to provide any form of support** for it. Use it at your own risk.
